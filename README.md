# weed_strains

My Awesome Project
Simple API that grabs all weed strains and tell users the type and what it does. I thought it will be cool to have an API for users with a passion for growing and gardening.


How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Mongo Framework of choice


Lessons Learned:
This project taught me how to get and use API keys. I also learned a lot from grabbing data from the API, such as indica and sativa strains of Weed, as well the affects.
Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
